html2epub
=========

Convert a bunch of HTML documents into an EPUB.

Right now itâ€™s just a script to extract tables of contents and make EPUBs from
HTML documents. Please consider this module as a proof of concept for now:
pretty much everything (including the name) is likely to change in the near
future.

Installation
------------

```
npm install html2epub -g
```
